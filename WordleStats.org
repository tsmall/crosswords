* Source Data

The source data is whether we won and, if so, the number of guesses it took us to find the word. These are stored in a single CSV file.

#+begin_src R :results none
  wordle_stats <-
    read_csv(file = "wordle.csv", col_types = cols(
      Date    = col_date(format = ""),
      Guesses = col_factor(levels = c('1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', 'X'))
    )) %>%
    mutate(
      Weekday = wday(Date, label = TRUE),
      Won = Guesses != 'X',
    ) %>%
    select(Date, Weekday, Won, Guesses)

  wordle_wins <- filter(wordle_stats, Won == TRUE)
#+end_src

Here are the last eight days worth of data.

#+begin_src R :colnames yes
  tail(wordle_stats, n = 8)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
|       Date | Weekday | Won  | Guesses |
|------------+---------+------+---------|

* Wins vs Losses

Here's a visualization of our overall win and loss percentages.

#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file wordle-wins-losses.png
  wordle_stats %>%
    group_by(Won) %>%
    count() %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(percent = `n` / sum(`n`)) %>%
    arrange(percent) %>%
    mutate(labels = scales::percent(percent)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = "", y = percent, fill = Won)) +
      geom_col() +
      geom_text(aes(label = labels), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
      coord_polar(theta = "y") +
      theme_void()
